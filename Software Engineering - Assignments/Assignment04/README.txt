Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to offer a random simulation of two (2) heroes (participant: Timmy and Harold) trying
to escape a Pit (Escape), while being chased by snorcs (participant). The simulation is always random,
hence the movements of heroes and snorcs are limited by their implemented behaviors (movement affordances),
but the sequence of these movements are always randomized for each program simulation/run. The program can 
progress on two (2) cases: the hero collide with a snorc (in which the hero loses health by the snorc's strength),
and if the hero has enough health to reach the end of the Pit. At the end of the program, the outcome of the heroe's 
escape from the Pit will be printed out onto the screen.
Enjoy!
